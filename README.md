# Port_Scanner
Port Scanning application with GUI - built in python 3.  
This application will scan all ports in a user defined range on a remote host and return a list of open ports.

## About this project
This is a post-beginner project I'm using to learn more about working with sockets and Tkinter in Python.  
It is the first real "Application" I've built from scratch and I'm learning most of this as I go along.  
This is also a good learning experience for Github usage so I'm making sure to log issues and use branches even though it'll most likely never be seen by another living person.

### Disclaimer
If you want to use any of this code for learning purposes then please feel free.  
I would not recommend using this code for any Production work as it is intended as a learning experience for myself and as such I make no guarantees that it works, is free of bugs or has a level of quality consistent with Production applications.
